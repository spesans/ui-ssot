# AGENTS.md

## Repo overview

This repository contains multiple UI sample projects. Each sample directory is a worldview boundary and must remain self-contained.

## Working rules

- Follow the nearest `AGENTS.md` and `SSOT.md` inside the sample you edit.
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Do not add cross-sample imports, links, or shared dependencies unless explicitly requested.

## Common commands

- `hp-sample/` verification: `cd hp-sample && npm run verify`
